# Murder Ink E-Sports Team
This is a website that I designed and developed for an E-Sports Team.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This website was extremely fun to make. I want to start by saying that other than the carbon fiber background and the gif team logo, everything else is CSS. I am happy with how the shattered background and the folder with tabs turned out. The blue pulse in the background is created with CSS animations and is adaptable to smaller viewports. The mobile version of this site has a really cool menu dropdown that I designed to keep with the style of the page. The user data is an iframe for the team stats and weapons. I think it looks really cool and I was happy to work on it.

## Optimizations

I would like to go back now that I have a lot more knowledge and add more tools for the team to use. An on-site random weapon picker, or a practice schedule linked to Google calendar for keeping the team informed of upcoming changes. Too many ideas to count, but I would love to have time to implement them.

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

This was a heavy vanilla CSS project when I made it. I really tried to push myself to make something unique by implementing the glow of the background and the customized background shattered colors effect. I got really comfortable with linear-gradient, pseudo-classes for clicked elements, and positiioning for the folder in different viewports.
